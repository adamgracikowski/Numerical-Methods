# Project 2: The Eigenvalue Problem for Tridiagonal matrices

**This project is currently under development.**

This project is being implemented as a part of Numerical Methods 2 academic course.

## Objective of the project:
The aim of the project was to implement a function which calculates [the condition number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number) of the [tridiagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix), [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix) and real matrix. The condition number is defined as the absolute value of the quotient of the eigenvalue returned by [the power method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration) and the eigenvalue returned by [the inverse power method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_iteration). For the implementation of the inverse power method, [Householder's reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder_transformation) are being used.

The matrix is stored in vectors $x$ and $y$. Thanks to the memory-efficient storage of the matrix, computations for huge matrices (e.g. size of $200000$) are possible.

## About the Implementation:

MATLAB was the imposed programming language for the implementation of the project.

## Presentation:

In the `Presentation` folder a file called `P2Z20_AGR` can be found.
As the academic course was conducted in Polish, all the contents of the presentation is sadly available only in Polish.
