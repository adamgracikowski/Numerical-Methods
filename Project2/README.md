## Objective of the project:

## About the Implementation:

MATLAB was the imposed programming language for the implementation of the project.

## More on the numerical methods used:

## Numerical tests:

## Presentation:

In the `Presentation` folder a file called `P2Z20_AGR` can be found.
As the academic course was conducted in Polish, all the contents of the presentation is sadly available only in Polish.
