## Objective of the project:

The aim of the project was to implement a function which calculates the double integral of $f$ over area $D$, where $D = D_1 - D_2$ and $D_1 = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$, $D_2 = {(x, y) \in R^2: |x| + |y| \leq 1}$ by dividing $D$ into $4n^2$ congruent triangles and applying a quadrature of the fourth order for each of the triangles.

## About the Implementation:

MATLAB was the imposed programming language for the implementation of the project.
The process of approximating the double integral over $D$ is performed by the function `P1Z28_AGR_int4n2`. The process of dividing the triangle into $n^2$ triangles is performed by the function `divideTriangleN2`. The functions was implemented in such a way so as to solve a general problem of dividing any triangle given by its vertices $p_0$, $p_1$, $p_2 \in R^2$.

In the process of the project evolution all other integration formulas, which were discussed during the lectures, were also implemented.
